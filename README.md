# CODES
Programming code refers to a set of instructions written in a programming language that a computer can execute to perform specific tasks or solve problems. It consists of a sequence of statements and expressions that define the logic and behavior of a program.

Programming Languages:
Programming code is written in various programming languages, each with its own syntax, semantics, and use cases. Examples include Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and many others.
Each language has its strengths and is chosen based on factors like application requirements, developer expertise, and performance needs.

Error Handling and Debugging:
Error Handling: Techniques to gracefully handle errors and exceptions that occur during program execution, ensuring the program can recover or fail safely.
Debugging: The process of identifying and fixing bugs or issues in the code. Tools like debuggers and logging are commonly used.

Understanding these key points helps in writing effective and efficient programming code, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale software applications.
